# TMatricesThermalRadiation
This repository contains the codes for tracking the modes computed from the SVD of an arbitrary square matrix, and the thermal angular spectrum from the SVD ob the absorption matrix obtained from the transfer matrix T over a frequency range. 
The notebooks "FunctionsThermal spectrum" and "SVDFunction" contain the main functions, whereas the notebooks called "Examples" contain the examples shown in the paper. 
Any question regarding the implementation, please reach me out: juan-diego.mazo-vasquez@mpl.pmg.de
