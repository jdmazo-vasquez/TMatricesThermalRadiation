# TMatricesThermalRadiation
This repository contains the codes for tracking the modes computed from the SVD of an arbitrary square matrix, and the thermal angular spectrum from the SVD of the absorption matrix obtained from the transfer matrix T over a frequency range. 
The notebooks "FunctionsThermal spectrum" and "SVDFunction" contain the main functions, whereas the notebooks called "Examples" contain the examples shown in the paper. 
The .zip folder contains the data files from which the figures in the paper were plotted, as well as the corresponding .plt files for plotting in gnuplot.
Any questions regarding the implementation, please get in touch with me by e-mail: juan-diego.mazo-vasquez@mpl.pmg.de
